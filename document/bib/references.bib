   abstract = {Next-generation sequencing technologies have been and continue to be deployed in clinical laboratories, enabling rapid transformations in genomic medicine. These technologies have reduced the cost of large-scale sequencing by several orders of magnitude, and continuous advances are being made. It is now feasible to analyze an individual's near-complete exome or genome to assist in the diagnosis of a wide array of clinical scenarios. Next-generation sequencing technologies are also facilitating further advances in therapeutic decision making and disease prediction for at-risk patients. However, with rapid advances come additional challenges involving the clinical validation and use of these constantly evolving technologies and platforms in clinical laboratories. To assist clinical laboratories with the validation of next-generation sequencing methods and platforms, the ongoing monitoring of next-generation sequencing testing to ensure quality results, and the interpretation and reporting of variants found using these technologies, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics has developed the following professional standards and guidelines. © American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics.},

   abstract = {Genomics comprises a set of current and valuable technologies implemented as selection tools in dairy cattle commercial breeding programs. The intensive progeny testing for production and reproductive traits based on genomic breeding values (GEBVs) has been crucial to increasing dairy cattle productivity. The knowledge of key genes and haplotypes, including their regulation mechanisms, as markers for productivity traits, may improve the strategies on the present and future for dairy cattle selection. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) such as quantitative trait loci (QTL), single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), or single-step genomic best linear unbiased prediction (ssGBLUP) methods have already been included in global dairy programs for the estimation of marker-assisted selection-derived effects. The increase in genetic progress based on genomic predicting accuracy has also contributed to the understanding of genetic effects in dairy cattle off-spring. However, the crossing within inbred-lines critically increased homozygosis with accumulated negative effects of inbreeding like a decline in reproductive performance. Thus, inaccurate-biased estimations based on empirical-conventional models of dairy production systems face an increased risk of providing suboptimal results derived from errors in the selection of candidates of high genetic merit-based just on low-heritability phenotypic traits. This extends the generation intervals and increases costs due to the significant reduction of genetic gains. The remarkable progress of genomic prediction increases the accurate selection of superior candidates. The scope of the present review is to summarize and discuss the advances and challenges of genomic tools for dairy cattle selection for optimizing breeding programs and controlling negative inbreeding depression effects on productivity and consequently, achieving economic-effective advances in food production efficiency. Particular attention is given to the potential genomic selection-derived results to facilitate precision management on modern dairy farms, including an overview of novel genome editing methodologies as perspectives toward the future.},

To address these gaps, the Medical Genome Initiative, a consortium of leading healthcare and research organizations in the US and Canada, was formed to expand access to high-quality clinical WGS by publishing best practices. Here, we present consensus recommendations on clinical WGS analytical validation for the diagnosis of individuals with suspected germline disease with a focus on test development, upfront considerations for test design, test validation practices, and metrics to monitor test performance. This work also provides insight into the current state of WGS testing at each member institution, including the utilization of reference and other standards across sites. Importantly, members of this initiative strongly believe that clinical WGS is an appropriate first-tier test for patients with rare genetic disorders, and at minimum is ready to replace chromosomal microarray analysis and whole-exome sequencing. The recommendations presented here should reduce the burden on laboratories introducing WGS into clinical practice, and support safe and effective WGS testing for diagnosis of germline disease.},

   abstract = {Comprehensive genome annotation is essential to understand the impact of clinically relevant variants. However, the absence of a standard for clinical reporting and browser display complicates the process of consistent interpretation and reporting. To address these challenges, Ensembl/GENCODE1 and RefSeq2 launched a joint initiative, the Matched Annotation from NCBI and EMBL-EBI (MANE) collaboration, to converge on human gene and transcript annotation and to jointly define a high-value set of transcripts and corresponding proteins. Here, we describe the MANE transcript sets for use as universal standards for variant reporting and browser display. The MANE Select set identifies a representative transcript for each human protein-coding gene, whereas the MANE Plus Clinical set provides additional transcripts at loci where the Select transcripts alone are not sufficient to report all currently known clinical variants. Each MANE transcript represents an exact match between the exonic sequences of an Ensembl/GENCODE transcript and its counterpart in RefSeq such that the identifiers can be used synonymously. We have now released MANE Select transcripts for 97% of human protein-coding genes, including all American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics Secondary Findings list v3.0 (ref. 3) genes. MANE transcripts are accessible from major genome browsers and key resources. Widespread adoption of these transcript sets will increase the consistency of reporting, facilitate the exchange of data regardless of the annotation source and help to streamline clinical interpretation.},

This advanced sequencing technology enables the rapid and cost-effective analysis of large-scale genomic data, allowing comprehensive exploration of the genetic landscape of diseases. In clinical diagnosis, NGS has proven to be a powerful tool for identifying disease-causing variants, enabling accurate and early detection of genetic disorders. Additionally, NGS facilitates the identification of novel disease-associated genes and variants, aiding in the development of targeted therapies and personalized treatment strategies. NGS greatly benefits precision medicine by enhancing our understanding of disease mechanisms and enabling the identification of specific molecular markers for disease subtypes, thus enabling tailored medical interventions based on individual characteristics. Furthermore, NGS contributes to the development of non-invasive diagnostic approaches, such as liquid biopsies, which can monitor disease progression and treatment response. The potential of NGS in clinical diagnosis and precision medicine is vast, yet challenges persist in data analysis, interpretation, and protocol standardization.

   abstract = {We have adopted an open bioinformatics ecosystem to address the challenges of bioinformatics implementation in public health laboratories (PHLs). Bioinformatics implementation for public health requires practitioners to undertake standardized bioinformatic analyses and generate reproducible, validated and auditable results. It is essential that data storage and analysis are scalable, portable and secure, and that implementation of bioinformatics fits within the operational constraints of the laboratory. We address these requirements using Terra, a web-based data analysis platform with a graphical user interface connecting users to bioinformatics analyses without the use of code. We have developed bioinformatics workflows for use with Terra that specifically meet the needs of public health practitioners. These Theiagen workflows perform genome assembly, quality control, and characterization, as well as construction of phylogeny for insights into genomic epidemiology. Additon-ally, these workflows use open-source containerized software and the WDL workflow language to ensure standardization and interoperability with other bioinformatics solutions, whilst being adaptable by the user. They are all open source and publicly available in Dockstore with the version-controlled code available in public GitHub repositories. They have been written to generate outputs in standardized file formats to allow for further downstream analysis and visualization with separate genomic epidemiology software. Testament to this solution meeting the requirements for bioinformatic implementation in public health, Theiagen workflows have collectively been used for over 5 million sample analyses in the last 2 years by over 90 public health laboratories in at least 40 different countries. Continued adoption of technological innovations and development of further workflows will ensure that this ecosystem continues to benefit PHLs.},

   abstract = {The first large genome fully sequenced by next-generation sequencing (NGS) was that of a bacteriophage using sequencing by synthesis (SBS) as a paradigm. SBS in NGS is underpinned by ‘reversible-terminator chemistry’. To grow from proof of concept to being both affordable and practical, SBS needed to overcome a series of challenges, each of which required the invention of new chemistries. These included the design and synthesis of unnatural deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), engineering a suitable polymerase, a new surface chemistry and an ingenious molecular solution to neutralize copying errors inherent to all polymerases. In this historical Perspective, we discuss how NGS was developed from Sanger sequencing, highlighting the chemistry behind this technology, which has impacted biology in unprecedented ways. A historical perspective on how next-generation sequencing chemistry was developed.},

   abstract = {Mutations, the irreversible changes in an organism's DNA sequence, are present in tissues at a variant allele frequency (VAF) ranging from ∼10-8 per bp for a founder mutation to ∼10-3 for a histologically normal tissue sample containing several independent clones – compared to 1%− 50% for a heterozygous tumor mutation or a polymorphism. The rarity of these events poses a challenge for accurate clinical diagnosis and prognosis, toxicology, and discovering new disease etiologies. Standard Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies report VAFs as low as 0.5% per nt, but reliably observing rarer precursor events requires additional sophistication to measure ultralow-frequency mutations. We detail the challenge; define terms used to characterize the results, which vary between laboratories and sometimes conflict between biologists and bioinformaticists; and describe recent innovations to improve standard NGS methodologies including: single-strand consensus sequence methods such as Safe-SeqS and SiMSen-Seq; tandem-strand consensus sequence methods such as o2n-Seq and SMM-Seq; and ultrasensitive parent-strand consensus sequence methods such as DuplexSeq, PacBio HiFi, SinoDuplex, OPUSeq, EcoSeq, BotSeqS, Hawk-Seq, NanoSeq, SaferSeq, and CODEC. Practical applications are also noted. Several methods quantify VAF down to 10-5 at a nt and mutation frequency (MF) in a target region down to 10-7 per nt. By expanding to > 1 Mb of sites never observed twice, thus forgoing VAF, other methods quantify MF < 10-9 per nt or < 15 errors per haploid genome. Clonal expansion cannot be directly distinguished from independent mutations by sequencing, so it is essential for a paper to report whether its MF counted only different mutations – the minimum independent-mutation frequency MFminI – or all mutations observed including recurrences – the larger maximum independent-mutation frequency MFmaxI which may reflect clonal expansion. Ultrasensitive methods reveal that, without their use, even mutations with VAF 0.5–1% are usually spurious.},

However, interpretation of the extensive genomic variant information that is being generated presents substantial challenges. In this Perspective, we outline multidimensional strategies for genetic diagnosis in patients with rare movement disorders. We examine bioinformatics tools and computational metrics that have been developed to facilitate accurate prioritization of disease-causing variants. Additionally, we highlight community-driven data-sharing and case-matchmaking platforms, which are designed to foster the discovery of new genotype–phenotype relationships. Finally, we consider how multiomic data integration might optimize diagnostic success by combining genomic, epigenetic, transcriptomic and/or proteomic profiling to enable a more holistic evaluation of variant effects. Together, the approaches that we discuss offer pathways to the improved understanding of the genetic basis of rare movement disorders.

   abstract = {The origins of genetics are to be found in Gregor Mendel's memoir on plant hybridization (1865). However, the word ‘genetics’ was only coined in 1906, to designate the new science of heredity. Founded upon the Mendelian method for analyzing the products of crosses, this science is distinguished by its explicit purpose of being a general ‘science of heredity’, and by the introduction of totally new biological concepts (in particular those of gene, genotype, and phenotype). In the 1910s, Mendelian genetics fused with the chromosomal theory of inheritance, giving rise to what is still called ‘classical genetics’. Within this framework, the gene is simultaneously a unit of function and transmission, a unit of recombination, and of mutation. Until the early 1950s, these concepts of the gene coincided. But when DNA was found to be the material basis of inheritance, this congruence dissolved. Then began the venture of molecular biology, which has never stopped revealing the complexity of the way in which hereditary material functions.},

   abstract = {Genomics comprises a set of current and valuable technologies implemented as selection tools in dairy cattle commercial breeding programs. The intensive progeny testing for production and reproductive traits based on genomic breeding values (GEBVs) has been crucial to increasing dairy cattle productivity. The knowledge of key genes and haplotypes, including their regulation mechanisms, as markers for productivity traits, may improve the strategies on the present and future for dairy cattle selection. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) such as quantitative trait loci (QTL), single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), or single-step genomic best linear unbiased prediction (ssGBLUP) methods have already been included in global dairy programs for the estimation of marker-assisted selection-derived effects. The increase in genetic progress based on genomic predicting accuracy has also contributed to the understanding of genetic effects in dairy cattle off-spring. However, the crossing within inbred-lines critically increased homozygosis with accumulated negative effects of inbreeding like a decline in reproductive performance. Thus, inaccurate-biased estimations based on empirical-conventional models of dairy production systems face an increased risk of providing suboptimal results derived from errors in the selection of candidates of high genetic merit-based just on low-heritability phenotypic traits. This extends the generation intervals and increases costs due to the significant reduction of genetic gains. The remarkable progress of genomic prediction increases the accurate selection of superior candidates. The scope of the present review is to summarize and discuss the advances and challenges of genomic tools for dairy cattle selection for optimizing breeding programs and controlling negative inbreeding depression effects on productivity and consequently, achieving economic-effective advances in food production efficiency. Particular attention is given to the potential genomic selection-derived results to facilitate precision management on modern dairy farms, including an overview of novel genome editing methodologies as perspectives toward the future.},

The article includes a historical perspective and summarises some of the early work which led to our understanding of this important molecule and how it functions; many of these pioneering scientists were awarded Nobel Prizes for their work. We explain the structure of the DNA molecule, how it is packaged into chromosomes and how it is replicated prior to cell division. We look at how the concept of the gene has developed since the term was first coined and how DNA is copied into RNA (transcription) and translated into protein (translation).},

We show here that in a subset of these systems, the mature crRNA that is base-paired to trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) forms a two-RNA structure that directs the CRISPR-associated protein Cas9 to introduce double-stranded (ds) breaks in target DNA. At sites complementary to the crRNA-guide sequence, the Cas9 HNH nuclease domain cleaves the complementary strand, whereas the Cas9 RuvC-like domain cleaves the noncomplementary strand. The dual-tracrRNA:crRNA, when engineered as a single RNA chimera, also directs sequence-specific Cas9 dsDNA cleavage. Our study reveals a family of endonucleases that use dual-RNAs for site-specific DNA cleavage and highlights the potential to exploit the system for RNA-programmable genome editing.},
