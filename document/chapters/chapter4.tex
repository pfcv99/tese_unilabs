\section{\acs{swot} Analysis} \label{sec:intro_swot}

During the development of the genomic analysis software, a \ac{swot} analysis was performed to assess its strategic positioning. The analysis identified internal strengths, weaknesses, and external opportunities and threats within bioinformatics and genomics. Figure \ref{fig:swot} summarize the key findings, outlining crucial elements that guided the software's development and deployment.
